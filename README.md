# PHP_CRUD
A Basic CRUD interface using PHP


The Entire Webapp Was developed using PHP, & Bootstrap 5

the MySQL Improved plugin was used for database connectivity with a local database named (Student), where it mainly reads data from a table named (Results)

# code.php

code.php containes the main handeling of each form and each function, like deletion, insertion, and editing.

# connection.php

a Simple file that has the database connectivity, and returns a $conn variable containing the connection

# Student-Create/Edit/View.php

Three Almost Identical pages with some edits, to allow the insertion, editing and viewing of data on the database.

# Styling

No custom CSS was written for this webapp, as bootstrap 5 was mostly used.

# Problems Faced

During Development, PHP was not set up correctly out-of-the-box, where a new php.ini file needed to be inserted
